MCMC code to simulate spins on a lattice


Monte Carlo code for simulating spins on a atomic lattice. An atomic lattice is just an arrangement of atoms into a crystal 
structure. In physics, a spin is an intrinsic property of elementary particles(such as electron). Mathematically it is just 
a vector. So, we arrange lots of these spins on a structure of our choice like below.
